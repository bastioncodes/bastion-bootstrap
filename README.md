**Bastion** streamlines Unity app and game development, providing a structured framework that promotes modular architecture, event-driven design, and best practices for scalable projects.

Its goal is to help developers build maintainable and flexible applications by offering clear conventions and a well-organized foundation. Whether you're working on a game, a mobile app, or an interactive experience, Bastion Bootstrap provides the tools to structure your project efficiently‚Äîso you can focus on creating great experiences.

This project is part of the vision behind [Bastion Codes](https://bastion.codes), a learning platform dedicated to making software development more accessible, engaging, and structured.
